.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBpts createuser\fR command creates an entry in the Protection Database
for each user or machine specified by the \fB\-name\fR argument. A user entry
name becomes the user's \s-1AFS\s0 username (the one to provide when
authenticating with the \s-1AFS\s0 Authentication Server).  A machine entry's
name is the machine's \s-1IP\s0 address or a wildcard notation that represents a
range of consecutive \s-1IP\s0 addresses (a group of machines on the same
network). It is not possible to authenticate as a machine, but a group to
which a machine entry belongs can appear on a directory's access control
list (\s-1ACL\s0), thereby granting the indicated permissions to any user logged
on to the machine.
.PP
\&\s-1AFS\s0 user IDs (\s-1AFS\s0 UIDs) are positive integers and by default the
Protection Server assigns an \s-1AFS\s0 \s-1UID\s0 that is one greater than the current
value of the \f(CW\*(C`max user id\*(C'\fR counter in the Protection Database,
incrementing the counter by one for each user. To assign a specific \s-1AFS\s0
\&\s-1UID\s0, use the \fB\-id\fR argument. If any of the specified \s-1AFS\s0 UIDs is greater
than the current value of the \f(CW\*(C`max user id\*(C'\fR counter, the counter is reset
to that value. It is acceptable to specify an \s-1AFS\s0 \s-1UID\s0 smaller than the
current value of the counter, but the creation operation fails if an
existing user or machine entry already has it. To display or set the value
of the \f(CW\*(C`max user id\*(C'\fR counter, use the \fBpts listmax\fR or \fBpts setmax\fR
command, respectively.
.PP
The issuer of the \fBpts createuser\fR command is recorded as the entry's
creator and the group system:administrators as its owner.
.SH "CAUTIONS"
.IX Header "CAUTIONS"
The Protection Server reserves \s-1AFS\s0 \s-1UID\s0 0 (zero) and returns an error if
the \fB\-id\fR argument has that value.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-name\fR <\fIuser name\fR>+" 4
.IX Item "-name <user name>+"
Specifies either a username for a user entry, or an \s-1IP\s0 address (complete
or wildcarded) for a machine entry:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
A username can include up to 63 numbers and lowercase letters, but it is
best to make it shorter than eight characters, because many application
programs cannot handle longer names. Also, it is best not to include shell
metacharacters or other punctuation marks. In particular, the colon (\f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR)
and at-sign (\f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR) characters are not acceptable. The period is generally
used only in special administrative names, to separate the username and an
\&\fIinstance\fR, as in the example \f(CW\*(C`pat.admin\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A machine identifier is its \s-1IP\s0 address in dotted decimal notation (for
example, 192.12.108.240), or a wildcard notation that represents a set of
\&\s-1IP\s0 addresses (a group of machines on the same network). The following are
acceptable wildcard formats. The letters \f(CW\*(C`W\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Y\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Z\*(C'\fR each
represent an actual number from the range 1 through 255.
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
W.X.Y.Z represents a single machine, for example \f(CW192.12.108.240\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
W.X.Y.0 matches all machines whose \s-1IP\s0 addresses start with the first three
numbers. For example, \f(CW192.12.108.0\fR matches both \f(CW192.12.108.119\fR and
\&\f(CW192.12.108.120\fR, but does not match \f(CW192.12.105.144\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
W.X.0.0 matches all machines whose \s-1IP\s0 addresses start with the first two
numbers. For example, the address \f(CW192.12.0.0\fR matches both
\&\f(CW192.12.106.23\fR and \f(CW192.12.108.120\fR, but does not match \f(CW192.5.30.95\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
W.0.0.0 matches all machines whose \s-1IP\s0 addresses start with the first
number in the specified address. For example, the address \f(CW192.0.0.0\fR
matches both \f(CW192.5.30.95\fR and \f(CW192.12.108.120\fR, but does not match
\&\f(CW138.255.63.52\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Do not define a machine entry with the name \f(CW0.0.0.0\fR to match every
machine. The system:anyuser group is equivalent.
.RE
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fB\-id\fR <\fIuser id\fR>+" 4
.IX Item "-id <user id>+"
Specifies an \s-1AFS\s0 \s-1UID\s0 for each user or machine entry, rather than allowing
the Protection Server to assign it. Provide a positive integer.
.Sp
If this argument is used and the \fB\-name\fR argument names multiple new
entries, it is best to provide an equivalent number of \s-1AFS\s0 UIDs.  The
first \s-1UID\s0 is assigned to the first entry, the second to the second entry,
and so on. If there are fewer UIDs than entries, the Protection Server
assigns UIDs to the unmatched entries based on the \f(CW\*(C`max user id\*(C'\fR
counter. If there are more UIDs than entries, the excess UIDs are
ignored. If any of the UIDs is greater than the current value of the \f(CW\*(C`max
user id\*(C'\fR counter, the counter is reset to that value.
.IP "\fB\-cell\fR <\fIcell name\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-cell <cell name>"
Names the cell in which to run the command. For more details, see
\&\fIpts\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-force\fR" 4
.IX Item "-force"
Enables the command to continue executing as far as possible when errors
or other problems occur, rather than halting execution at the first error.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
.IP "\fB\-localauth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-localauth"
Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
\&\fI/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile\fR file. Do not combine this flag with the \fB\-cell\fR 
or \fB\-noauth\fR options. For more details, see \fIpts\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-noauth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noauth"
Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the issuer. For more
details, see \fIpts\fR\|(1).
.SH "OUTPUT"
.IX Header "OUTPUT"
The command generates the following string to confirm creation of each
user:
.PP
