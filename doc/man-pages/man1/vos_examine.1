.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBvos examine\fR command formats and displays information from the
Volume Location Database (\s-1VLDB\s0) entry and the volume header of the volume
specified by the \fB\-id\fR argument.
.PP
To display the volume header only, use the \fBvos listvol\fR command. To
display information from the \s-1VLDB\s0 only, use the \fBvos listvldb\fR command.
.SH "CAUTIONS"
.IX Header "CAUTIONS"
Currently, the maximum size of a volume is 2 terabytes (2^31 bytes).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-id\fR <\fIvolume name or \s-1ID\s0\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-id <volume name or ID>"
Specifies either the complete name or volume \s-1ID\s0 number of the volume,
which can be read/write, read-only, or backup.
.IP "\fB\-extended\fR" 4
.IX Item "-extended"
Displays statistics about read and write operations on files and
directories in the volume.
.IP "\fB\-format\fR" 4
.IX Item "-format"
Shows information in a format suitable for machine parsing.
.IP "\fB\-cell\fR <\fIcell name\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-cell <cell name>"
Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the \fB\-localauth\fR flag. For more details, see \fIvos\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-noauth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noauth"
Assigns the unprivileged identity \f(CW\*(C`anonymous\*(C'\fR to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the \fB\-localauth\fR flag. For more details, see
\&\fIvos\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-localauth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-localauth"
Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
\&\fI/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile\fR file. The \fBvos\fR command interpreter presents it
to the Volume Server and Volume Location Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the \fB\-cell\fR argument or
\&\fB\-noauth\fR flag. For more details, see \fIvos\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-verbose"
Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the command's
execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings and error messages
appear.
.IP "\fB\-encrypt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-encrypt"
Encrypts the command so that the operation's results are not transmitted
across the network in clear text. This option is available in OpenAFS
versions 1.4.11 or later and 1.5.60 or later.
.IP "\fB\-noresolve\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noresolve"
Shows all servers as \s-1IP\s0 addresses instead of the \s-1DNS\s0 name. This is very
useful when the server address is registered as 127.0.0.1 or when dealing
with multi-homed servers. This option is available in OpenAFS
versions 1.4.8 or later and 1.5.35 or later.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
.SH "OUTPUT"
.IX Header "OUTPUT"
The first seven lines of the output show information from the volume
header and the remaining lines come from the \s-1VLDB\s0. Each item in the
following list corresponds to a line of output derived from the volume
header.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Basic information about the specified volume (displayed on a single
line):
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
Name
.IP "\(bu" 4
Volume \s-1ID\s0 number
.IP "\(bu" 4
Type (the flag is \f(CW\*(C`RW\*(C'\fR for read/write, \f(CW\*(C`RO\*(C'\fR for read-only, \f(CW\*(C`BK\*(C'\fR for
backup)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Size in kilobytes (\f(CW1024\fR equals a megabyte)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Number of files in the volume, if the \fB\-extended\fR flag is provided
.IP "\(bu" 4
Status on the file server machine, which is one of the following:
.RS 4
.IP "On-line" 4
.IX Item "On-line"
The volume is completely accessible to Cache Managers.
.IP "Off-line" 4
.IX Item "Off-line"
The volume is not accessible to Cache Managers, but does not seem to be
corrupted. This status appears while a volume is being dumped, for
example.
.IP "Off\-line**needs salvage**" 4
.IX Item "Off-line**needs salvage**"
The volume is not accessible to Cache Managers, because it seems to be
corrupted. Use the \fBbos salvage\fR or \fBsalvager\fR command to repair the
corruption.

.IP "\(bu" 4
The file server machine and partition that house the volume, as determined
by the command interpreter as the command runs, rather than derived from
the \s-1VLDB\s0 or the volume header.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The volume \s-1ID\s0 numbers associated with the various versions of the volume:
read/write (\f(CW\*(C`RWrite\*(C'\fR), read-only (\f(CW\*(C`ROnly\*(C'\fR), backup (\f(CW\*(C`Backup\*(C'\fR), and
ReleaseClone (\f(CW\*(C`RClone\*(C'\fR). One of them matches the volume \s-1ID\s0 number that
appears on the first line of the volume's output. If the value in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`RWrite\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ROnly\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`Backup\*(C'\fR field is \f(CW0\fR (zero), there is no volume
of that type. If there is currently no ReleaseClone, the \f(CW\*(C`RClone\*(C'\fR field
does not appear at all.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The maximum space quota allotted to the read/write copy of the volume,
expressed in kilobyte blocks in the \f(CW\*(C`MaxQuota\*(C'\fR field.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The date and time the volume was created, in the \f(CW\*(C`Creation\*(C'\fR field. If the
volume has been restored with the \fBbackup diskrestore\fR, \fBbackup
volrestore\fR, or \fBvos restore\fR command, this is the restore time. For a
read-only volume, this is the last release time.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The date and time this copy of this volume was created, in the \f(CW\*(C`Copy\*(C'\fR
field.  This is the time when the volume was created on this server and
partition.  For read-only volumes, it is not updated by a release (unlike
the Creation date).  The copy date is not stored in volume dumps.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The date and time when the contents of the volume last changed, in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Last Update\*(C'\fR field. For read-only and backup volumes, it matches the
timestamp in the \f(CW\*(C`Creation\*(C'\fR field.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The number of times the volume has been accessed for a fetch or store
operation since the later of the two following times:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
12:00 a.m. on the day the command is issued
.IP "\(bu" 4
The last time the volume changed location
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.PP
When the \fB\-extended\fR flag is included, two tables appear next:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The table labeled \f(CW\*(C`Raw Read/Write Stats\*(C'\fR contains information on the
number of reads (fetches) and writes (stores) made on the specified
volume.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The table labeled \f(CW\*(C`Writes Affecting Authorship\*(C'\fR contains information on
writes made to files and directories in the specified volume.
.PP
If the following message appears instead of the previously listed
information, it indicates that a volume is not accessible to Cache
Managers or the \fBvos\fR command interpreter, for example because a clone is
being created.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   **** Volume <volume_ID> is busy ****
.Ve
.PP
If the following message appears instead of the previously listed
information, it indicates that the File Server is unable to attach the
volume, perhaps because it is seriously corrupted. The \fIFileLog\fR and
\&\fIVolserLog\fR log files in the \fI/usr/afs/logs\fR directory on the file
server machine possibly provide additional information; use the \fBbos
getlog\fR command to display them.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   **** Could not attach volume <volume_ID> ****
.Ve
.PP
Following a blank line, information from the \s-1VLDB\s0 entry appears.  Each
item in this list corresponds to a separate line in the output:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The base (read/write) volume name. The read-only and backup versions have
the same name with a \f(CW\*(C`.readonly\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`.backup\*(C'\fR extension, respectively.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The volume \s-1ID\s0 numbers allocated to the versions of the volume that
actually exist, in fields labeled \f(CW\*(C`RWrite\*(C'\fR for the read/write, \f(CW\*(C`ROnly\*(C'\fR
for the read-only, \f(CW\*(C`Backup\*(C'\fR for the backup, and \f(CW\*(C`RClone\*(C'\fR for the
ReleaseClone. (If a field does not appear, the corresponding version of
the volume does not exist.) The appearance of the \f(CW\*(C`RClone\*(C'\fR field normally
indicates that a release operation did not complete successfully; the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Old release\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`New release\*(C'\fR flags often also appear on one or more
of the site definition lines described just following.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The number of sites that house a read/write or read-only copy of the
volume, following the string \f(CW\*(C`number of sites \->\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A line for each site that houses a read/write or read-only copy of the
volume, specifying the file server machine, partition, and type of volume
(\f(CW\*(C`RW\*(C'\fR for read/write or \f(CW\*(C`RO\*(C'\fR for read-only). If a backup version exists,
it is understood to share the read/write site.  Several flags can appear
with a site definition:
.RS 4
.IP "Not released" 4
.IX Item "Not released"
Indicates that the vos release command has not been issued since the \fBvos
addsite\fR command was used to define the read-only site.
.IP "Old release" 4
.IX Item "Old release"
Indicates that a vos release command did not complete successfully,
leaving the previous, obsolete version of the volume at this site.
.IP "New release" 4
.IX Item "New release"
Indicates that a vos release command did not complete successfully, but
that this site did receive the correct new version of the volume.
