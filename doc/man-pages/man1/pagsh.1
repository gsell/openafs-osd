.SH "NAME"
pagsh, pagsh.krb \- Creates a new PAG
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBpagsh\fR
.PP
\&\fBpagsh.krb\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBpagsh\fR command creates a new command shell (owned by the issuer of
the command) and associates a new \fIprocess authentication group\fR (\s-1PAG\s0)
with the shell and the user. A \s-1PAG\s0 is a number guaranteed to identify the
issuer of commands in the new shell uniquely to the local Cache
Manager. The \s-1PAG\s0 is used, instead of the issuer's \s-1UNIX\s0 \s-1UID\s0, to identify
the issuer in the credential structure that the Cache Manager creates to
track each user.
.PP
Any tokens acquired subsequently (presumably for other cells) become
associated with the \s-1PAG\s0, rather than with the user's \s-1UNIX\s0 \s-1UID\s0.  This
method for distinguishing users has two advantages:
.IP "\(bu" 2
It means that processes spawned by the user inherit the \s-1PAG\s0 and so share
the token; thus they gain access to \s-1AFS\s0 as the authenticated user.  In
many environments, for example, printer and other daemons run under
identities (such as the local superuser \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR) that the \s-1AFS\s0 server
processes recognize only as \f(CW\*(C`anonymous\*(C'\fR. Unless PAGs are used, such
daemons cannot access files in directories whose access control lists
(ACLs) do not extend permissions to the system:anyuser group.
.IP "\(bu" 2
It closes a potential security loophole: \s-1UNIX\s0 allows anyone already logged
in as the local superuser \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR on a machine to assume any other
identity by issuing the \s-1UNIX\s0 \fBsu\fR command. If the credential structure is
identified by a \s-1UNIX\s0 \s-1UID\s0 rather than a \s-1PAG\s0, then the local superuser
\&\f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR can assume a \s-1UNIX\s0 \s-1UID\s0 and use any tokens associated with that
\&\s-1UID\s0. Use of a \s-1PAG\s0 as an identifier eliminates that possibility.
.PP
The (mostly obsolete) \fBpagsh.krb\fR command is the same as \fBpagsh\fR except
that it also sets the \s-1KRBTKFILE\s0 environment variable, which controls the
default Kerberos v4 ticket cache, to \fI/tmp/tktp\fIX\fI\fR where \fIX\fR is the
number of the user's \s-1PAG\s0.  This is only useful for \s-1AFS\s0 cells still using
Kerberos v4 outside of \s-1AFS\s0 and has no effect for cells using Kerberos v5
and \fBaklog\fR or \fBklog.krb5\fR.
.SH "CAUTIONS"
.IX Header "CAUTIONS"
Each \s-1PAG\s0 created uses two of the memory slots that the kernel uses to
record the \s-1UNIX\s0 groups associated with a user. If none of these slots are
available, the \fBpagsh\fR command fails. This is not a problem with most
operating systems, which make at least 16 slots available per user.
.PP
In cells that do not use an AFS-modified login utility, use this command
to obtain a \s-1PAG\s0 before issuing the \fBklog\fR command (or include the
\&\fB\-setpag\fR argument to the \fBklog\fR command). If a \s-1PAG\s0 is not acquired, the
Cache Manager stores the token in a credential structure identified by
local \s-1UID\s0 rather than \s-1PAG\s0. This creates the potential security exposure
described in \s-1DESCRIPTION\s0.
.PP
If users of \s-1NFS\s0 client machines for which \s-1AFS\s0 is supported are to issue
this command as part of authenticating with \s-1AFS\s0, do not use the \fBfs
exportafs\fR command's \fB\-uidcheck on\fR argument to enable \s-1UID\s0 checking on
\&\s-1NFS/AFS\s0 Translator machines. Enabling \s-1UID\s0 checking prevents this command
from succeeding. See \fIklog\fR\|(1).
.PP
If \s-1UID\s0 checking is not enabled on Translator machines, then by default it
is possible to issue this command on a properly configured \s-1NFS\s0 client
machine that is accessing \s-1AFS\s0 via the \s-1NFS/AFS\s0 Translator, assuming that
the \s-1NFS\s0 client machine is a supported system type. The \fBpagsh\fR binary
accessed by the \s-1NFS\s0 client must be owned by, and grant setuid privilege
to, the local superuser \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR. The complete set of mode bits must be
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-rwsr\-xr\-x\*(C'\fR. This is not a requirement when the command is issued on \s-1AFS\s0
client machines.
.PP
However, if the translator machine's administrator has enabled \s-1UID\s0
checking by including the \fB\-uidcheck on\fR argument to the \fBfs exportafs\fR
command, the command fails with an error message similar to the following:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   Warning: Remote setpag to <translator_machine> has failed (err=8). . .
\&   setpag: Exec format error
