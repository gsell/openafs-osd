.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBvos status\fR command reports on what the Volume Server on a certain
file server machine is doing at the moment the command is issued. If there
is no activity, the following message appears:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   No active transactions on <machine_name>
.Ve
.PP
This command is useful mainly if there is concern that the Volume Server
is not performing requested actions.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-server\fR <\fIserver name\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-server <server name>"
Identifies the file server machine running the Volume Server for which to
display status information. Provide the machine's \s-1IP\s0 address or its host
name (either fully qualified or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For
details, see \fIvos\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-cell\fR <\fIcell name\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-cell <cell name>"
Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the \fB\-localauth\fR flag. For more details, see \fIvos\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-noauth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noauth"
Assigns the unprivileged identity \f(CW\*(C`anonymous\*(C'\fR to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the \fB\-localauth\fR flag. For more details, see
\&\fIvos\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-localauth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-localauth"
Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
\&\fI/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile\fR file. The \fBvos\fR command interpreter presents it
to the Volume Server and Volume Location Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the \fB\-cell\fR argument or
\&\fB\-noauth\fR flag. For more details, see \fIvos\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-verbose"
Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the command's
execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings and error messages
appear.
.IP "\fB\-encrypt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-encrypt"
Encrypts the command so that the operation's results are not transmitted
across the network in clear text. This option is available in OpenAFS
versions 1.4.11 or later and 1.5.60 or later.
.IP "\fB\-noresolve\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noresolve"
Shows all servers as \s-1IP\s0 addresses instead of the \s-1DNS\s0 name. This is very
useful when the server address is registered as 127.0.0.1 or when dealing
with multi-homed servers. This option is available in OpenAFS
versions 1.4.8 or later and 1.5.35 or later.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
.SH "OUTPUT"
.IX Header "OUTPUT"
There are two possible types of output.
.PP
The following message indicates that the Volume Server is not currently
performing any actions.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   No active transactions on I<machine name>
.Ve
.PP
The other possible output is a set of information which is probably more
useful to programmers than to system administrators. A full understanding
of all the fields requires familiarity with the code for the Volume
Server, as many of the fields report \s-1ID\s0 numbers and flag values that the
Volume Server sets for internal use.
.PP
Among the fields of possible interest to an administrator are:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`created\*(C'\fR on the first line, which indicates the time at which this
transaction started
.IP "\(bu" 4
In OpenAFS 1.5.75 and later, \f(CW\*(C`lastActiveTime\*(C'\fR on the second line, which
indicates the last time an \s-1RPC\s0 interacted with this transaction
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`attachFlags\*(C'\fR on the third line, where a value of \f(CW\*(C`offline\*(C'\fR indicates
that the volume is not available for other read or write operations during
this transaction
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`volume\*(C'\fR on the fourth line, which specifies the affected volume's \s-1ID\s0
number
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`partition\*(C'\fR on the fourth line, which indicates where the affected volume
resides (at the beginning of the transaction if this is a move)
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`procedure\*(C'\fR on the fourth line, which indicates the internal subprocedure
being executed
.PP
A fifth line can appear during certain transactions, and includes the
following fields:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`packetRead\*(C'\fR tracks whether information is being read into the
volume. Its absolute value is not informative, but the way it changes
shows whether the \fBvos restore\fR command is executing properly.  As the
\&\fBvos status\fR command is issued repeatedly during a restore, \f(CW\*(C`readNext\*(C'\fR
increases monotonically to indicate that information is being read into
the volume.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`packetSend\*(C'\fR tracks whether information is being sent out of the
volume. Its absolute value is not informative, but the way it changes
shows whether the \fBvos dump\fR command is executing properly. As the \fBvos
status\fR command is issued repeatedly during a dump, \f(CW\*(C`transmitNext\*(C'\fR
increases monotonically to indicate that information is being transferred
from the volume into the dump file.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`lastReceiveTime\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`lastSendTime\*(C'\fR are for internal use.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
The following example illustrates the kind of output that sometimes
appears when the Volume Server on \f(CW\*(C`fs1.abc.com\*(C'\fR is executing a dump at
the time this command is issued.
.PP
