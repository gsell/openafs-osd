    [\fB\-l\fR] [\fB\-c\fR\ <\fIcell\ name\fR>] [\fB\-h\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBbackup dumpinfo\fR command formats and displays the Backup Database
record for the specified dumps. To specify how many of the most recent
dumps to display, starting with the newest one and going back in time, use
the \fB\-ndumps\fR argument. To display more detailed information about a
single dump, use the \fB\-id\fR argument. To display the records for the 10
most recent dumps, omit both the \fB\-ndumps\fR and \fB\-id\fR arguments.
.PP
The \fB\-verbose\fR flag produces very detailed information that is useful
mostly for debugging purposes. It can be combined only with the \fB\-id\fR
argument.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-ndumps\fR <\fInumber of dumps\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-ndumps <number of dumps>"
Displays the Backup Database record for each of the specified number of
dumps that were most recently performed. If the database contains fewer
dumps than are requested, the output includes the records for all existing
dumps. Do not combine this argument with the \fB\-id\fR or \fB\-verbose\fR
options; omit all options to display the records for the last 10 dumps.
.IP "\fB\-id\fR <\fIdump id\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-id <dump id>"
Specifies the dump \s-1ID\s0 number of a single dump for which to display the
Backup Database record. Precede the \fIdump id\fR value with the \fB\-id\fR
switch; otherwise, the command interpreter interprets it as the value of
the \fB\-ndumps\fR argument. Combine this argument with the \fB\-verbose\fR flag,
but not with the \fB\-ndumps\fR argument; omit all options to display the
records for the last 10 dumps.
.IP "\fB\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-verbose"
Provides more detailed information about the dump specified with the
\&\fB\-id\fR argument, which must be provided along with it. Do not combine this
flag with the \fB\-ndumps\fR argument.
.IP "\fB\-localauth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-localauth"
Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
\&\fI/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile\fR file. The \fBbackup\fR command interpreter presents
it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and \s-1VL\s0 Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the \fB\-cell\fR argument. For
more details, see \fIbackup\fR\|(8).
.IP "\fB\-cell\fR <\fIcell name\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-cell <cell name>"
Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the \fB\-localauth\fR flag. For more details, see \fIbackup\fR\|(8).
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
.SH "OUTPUT"
.IX Header "OUTPUT"
If the \fB\-ndumps\fR argument is provided, the output presents the following
information in table form, with a separate line for each dump:
.IP "dumpid" 4
.IX Item "dumpid"
The dump \s-1ID\s0 number.
.IP "parentid" 4
.IX Item "parentid"
The dump \s-1ID\s0 number of the dump's parent dump. A value of \f(CW0\fR (zero)
identifies a full dump.
.IP "lv" 4
.IX Item "lv"
The depth in the dump hierarchy of the dump level used to create the
dump. A value of \f(CW0\fR (zero) identifies a full dump, in which case the
value in the \f(CW\*(C`parentid\*(C'\fR field is also \f(CW0\fR. A value of \f(CW1\fR or greater
indicates an incremental dump made at the corresponding level in the dump
hierarchy.
.IP "created" 4
.IX Item "created"
The date and time at which the Backup System started the dump operation
that created the dump.
.IP "nt" 4
.IX Item "nt"
The number of tapes that contain the data in the dump. A value of \f(CW0\fR
(zero) indicates that the dump operation was terminated or failed. Use the
\&\fBbackup deletedump\fR command to remove such entries.
.IP "nvols" 4
.IX Item "nvols"
The number of volumes from which the dump includes data. If a volume spans
tapes, it is counted twice. A value of \f(CW0\fR (zero) indicates that the dump
operation was terminated or failed; the value in the \f(CW\*(C`nt\*(C'\fR field is also
\&\f(CW0\fR in this case.
.IP "dump name" 4
.IX Item "dump name"
The dump name in the form
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   <volume_set_name>.<dump_level_name> (<initial_dump_ID>)
.Ve
.Sp
where <volume_set_name> is the name of the volume set, and
<dump_level_name> is the last element in the dump level pathname at which
the volume set was dumped.
.Sp
The <initial_dump_ID>, if displayed, is the dump \s-1ID\s0 of the initial dump in
the dump set to which this dump belongs. If there is no value in
parentheses, the dump is the initial dump in a dump set that has no
appended dumps.
.PP
If the \fB\-id\fR argument is provided alone, the first line of output begins
with the string \f(CW\*(C`Dump\*(C'\fR and reports information for the entire dump in the
following fields:
.IP "id" 4
.IX Item "id"
The dump \s-1ID\s0 number.
.IP "level" 4
.IX Item "level"
The depth in the dump hierarchy of the dump level used to create the
dump. A value of \f(CW0\fR (zero) identifies a full dump. A value of \f(CW1\fR (one)
or greater indicates an incremental dump made at the specified level in
the dump hierarchy.
.IP "volumes" 4
.IX Item "volumes"
The number of volumes for which the dump includes data.
.IP "created" 4
.IX Item "created"
The date and time at which the dump operation began.
.PP
If an \s-1XBSA\s0 server was the backup medium for the dump (rather than a tape
device or backup data file), the following line appears next:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   Backup Service: <XBSA_program>: Server: <hostname>
.Ve
.PP
where <XBSA_program> is the name of the XBSA-compliant program and
<hostname> is the name of the machine on which the program runs.
.PP
Next the output includes an entry for each tape that houses volume data
from the dump. Following the string \f(CW\*(C`Tape\*(C'\fR, the first two lines of each
entry report information about that tape in the following fields:
.IP "name" 4
.IX Item "name"
The tape's permanent name if it has one, or its \s-1AFS\s0 tape name otherwise,
and its tape \s-1ID\s0 number in parentheses.
.IP "nVolumes" 4
.IX Item "nVolumes"
The number of volumes for which this tape includes dump data.
.IP "created" 4
.IX Item "created"
The date and time at which the Tape Coordinator began writing data to this
tape.
.PP
Following another blank line, the tape-specific information concludes with
a table that includes a line for each volume dump on the tape. The
information appears in columns with the following headings:
.IP "Pos" 4
.IX Item "Pos"
The relative position of each volume in this tape or file. On a tape, the
counter begins at position 2 (the tape label occupies position 1), and
increments by one for each volume. For volumes in a backup data file, the
position numbers start with 1 and do not usually increment only by one,
because each is the ordinal of the 16 \s-1KB\s0 offset in the file at which the
volume's data begins. The difference between the position numbers
therefore indicates how many 16 \s-1KB\s0 blocks each volume's data occupies. For
example, if the second volume is at position 5 and the third volume in the
list is at position 9, that means that the dump of the second volume
occupies 64 \s-1KB\s0 (four 16\-KB blocks) of space in the file.
.IP "Clone time" 4
.IX Item "Clone time"
For a backup or read-only volume, the time at which it was cloned from its
read/write source. For a Read/Write volume, it is the same as the dump
creation date reported on the first line of the output.
.IP "Nbytes" 4
.IX Item "Nbytes"
The number of bytes of data in the dump of the volume.
.IP "Volume" 4
.IX Item "Volume"
The volume name, complete with \f(CW\*(C`.backup\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`.readonly\*(C'\fR extension if
appropriate.
.PP
If both the \fB\-id\fR and \fB\-verbose\fR options are provided, the output is
divided into several sections:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The first section, headed by the underlined string \f(CW\*(C`Dump\*(C'\fR, includes
information about the entire dump. The fields labeled \f(CW\*(C`id\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`level\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`created\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`nVolumes\*(C'\fR report the same values (though in a different
order) as appear on the first line of output when the \fB\-id\fR argument is
provided by itself.  Other fields of potential interest to the backup
operator are:
.RS 4
.IP "Group id" 4
.IX Item "Group id"
The dump's \fIgroup \s-1ID\s0 number\fR, which is recorded in the dump's Backup
Database record if the \f(CW\*(C`GROUPID\*(C'\fR instruction appears in the Tape
Coordinator's \fI/usr/afs/backup/CFG_\fItcid\fI\fR file when the dump is
created.
.IP "maxTapes" 4
.IX Item "maxTapes"
The number of tapes that contain the dump set to which this dump belongs.
.IP "Start Tape Seq" 4
.IX Item "Start Tape Seq"
The ordinal of the tape on which this dump begins in the set of tapes that
contain the dump set.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\(bu" 4
For each tape that contains data from this dump, there follows a section
headed by the underlined string \f(CW\*(C`Tape\*(C'\fR. The fields labeled \f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`written\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`nVolumes\*(C'\fR report the same values (though in a different
order) as appear on the second and third lines of output when the \fB\-id\fR
argument is provided by itself. Other fields of potential interest to the
backup operator are:
.RS 4
.IP "expires" 4
.IX Item "expires"
The date and time when this tape can be recycled, because all dumps it
contains have expired.
.IP "nMBytes Data and nBytes Data" 4
.IX Item "nMBytes Data and nBytes Data"
Summed together, these fields represent the total amount of dumped data
actually from volumes (as opposed to labels, filemarks, and other
markers).
.IP "KBytes Tape Used" 4
.IX Item "KBytes Tape Used"
The number of kilobytes of tape (or disk space, for a backup data file)
used to store the dump data. It is generally larger than the sum of the
values in the \f(CW\*(C`nMBytes Data\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`nBytes Data\*(C'\fR fields, because it
includes the space required for the label, file marks and other markers,
and because the Backup System writes data at 16 \s-1KB\s0 offsets, even if the
data in a given block doesn't fill the entire 16 \s-1KB\s0.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\(bu" 4
For each volume on a given tape, there follows a section headed by the
underlined string \f(CW\*(C`Volume\*(C'\fR. The fields labeled \f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`position\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`clone\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`nBytes\*(C'\fR report the same values (though in a different
order) as appear in the table that lists the volumes in each tape when the
\&\fB\-id\fR argument is provided by itself. Other fields of potential interest
to the backup operator are:
.RS 4
.IP "id" 4
.IX Item "id"
The volume \s-1ID\s0.
.IP "tape" 4
.IX Item "tape"
The name of the tape containing this volume data.
